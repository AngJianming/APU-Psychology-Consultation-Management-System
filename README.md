# APU-Psychology-Consultation-Management-System

Psychology consultation management system for Asia Pacific University Innovation &amp; Technology (APU). The target users of the system are **students** and **psychology lecturers**. The expected system must be able to perform some mandatory operations such as user registration, and appointment management.<br><br>
We constructed a software solution using object-oriented Java approach and all the data is saved in text file. Furthermore, a supporting document is added to this repository to reflect the implementation details demonstrating the implementation of different object-oriented concepts with code samples.
